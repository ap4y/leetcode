* Notes

** List operations

- Can use hash to do o(n) cross-match

- Can use sliding-window (potentially with hash) for longest combination search

** Linked lists

- Recursion works really well

** Median

- The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample:
  (arr[(len - 1) / 2] + arr[len / 2]) / 2.0
** Palindrome

- Can be found by expanding window from the center
- Have to check twice for 1 (abac) and 2 (abbac) letter combinations
** Number operations

- Use pop: ~num % 2; num / 10~ and push ~num * 10 + mod~
